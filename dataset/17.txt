A look back at Michael Jordan's first return from retirement 28 years ago
Michael Jordan announced his return with the now iconic "I'm back" fax.

On March 19th, 1995, Michael Jordan set the sports world on fire with just two words: "I'm back." This was the start of MJ's first return from retirement, following a break from the game he had so famously dominated. But the circus was just beginning; Jordan suited up for the Chicago Bulls the next day as they visited Market Square Arena to take on the Indiana Pacers.

According to a report by the Indianapolis Star, the Pacers' PR department was swamped when news broke out that Jordan would make his long-awaited return to the NBA on the Pacers' home court. David Benner, a PR rep for the Pacers at the time, said:

"It was like David Stern (the NBA commissioner at the time) deciding the NBA championship would be a one-game playoff, and that one game is in your building, and you've got 24 hours to prepare."

The Pacers received dozens of media requests in what became known as "The Second Coming." Even Reggie Miller noticed that the vibe was very different than in their usual home games.

"I've never seen a place where 16,000 were already in the seats before the teams came out (for warm-ups)," he said. "We've come a long way, because in years past, I remember when they ran out, the place went crazy, and we got booed," Reggie said.

After being away from the NBA for almost a year and a half, Jordan played like a mortal and had just 19 points, missing 21 of his 28 shot attempts during that game. The Bulls also lost that game, 103-96, in overtime. Despite the less-than-stellar performance, Jordan remarked he felt good playing NBA basketball once again.
