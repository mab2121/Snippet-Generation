On Nov. 9, 1989, East Germany opened the Berlin Wall, allowing travel from East to West Berlin. That night, Germans celebrated the move by tearing the wall down.

The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 during the Cold War to separate the Soviet-controlled East and the Democratic West.

The wall, made of concrete and barbed wire, stood for 28 years.

As the Cold War came to an end, East German officials announced that citizens were free to cross the country's borders. After the announcement, citizens of East and West Berlin flocked to the wall in celebration. They chanted, drank beer and destroyed the wall with hammers and picks.

Soon, the wall was destroyed, and Berlin was united for the first time since 1945.

The destruction of the Berlin Wall is considered one of the most significant events leading to the end of the Cold War.
